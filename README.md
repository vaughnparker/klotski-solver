# klotski-solver

I recently completed a playthrough of **Professor Layton and the Curious Village**, one of my favorite games from my childhood. After beating the main game, you get access to the post-game puzzles, which are the hardest in the game. The final puzzle is a sliding puzzle called the Royal Escape.

Along the way, I disvoered that this is puzzle is actually a classic sliding-block puzzle known historically as **Klotski**. I highly recommend the video from 2swap, [I Solved Klotski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLNyHd2w10) for a more comprehensive discussion of what the state space looks like and why it's harder than it seems (I kept falling into the "dense pit" he describes).

I was not able to solve the puzzle on my own, so while I do think that this is a form of cheating, I wrote a solver using Python/Jupyter Notebook.
